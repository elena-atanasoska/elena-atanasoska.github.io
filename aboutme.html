        Hello, my name is Elena Atanasoska and I have just started my Masterâ€™s Degree in Data Science at FCIS in Ljubljana, Slovenia.
        During my undergraduate studies at the Faculty of  Computer Science and Engineering
        in Skopje, Macedonia, I obtained the knowledge one Software Developer requires.
        I  love to work and study at the same time. <br>

    <h4>My top strengths:</h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>HIGHLY INDEPENDENT</dt>
        <dd>I am comfortable in my own company and I am self-aware.
            I like to self-reflect and usually find it easy to focus.</dd>
        <dt>VERY EMOTIVE</dt>
        <dd>I get very involved in my work, and this passion
            shows. I care even about the small things.</dd>
        <dt>AUTONOMOUS</dt>
        <dd>While able to work as part of a team, it's when I am
            given the opportunity to think independently that I do
            my best work.</dd>
        <dt>ANALYTICAL</dt>
        <dd>I prefer to think a situation over before getting stuck
            in. I use reason and logic to get to the heart of a
            problem.</dd>
