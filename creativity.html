    <p>Your <b>CREATIVITY</b> measures how original and innovative your thinking is, or
        how logical and analytical it is. You're full of new ideas, but you also know when to do things the
        tried-and-tested way. You enjoy being able to bring an original
        approach to a traditional environment.

    <h3>I AM ADAPTABLE in MY CREATIVITY</h3>

    <h3>I AM SLIGHTLY MORE CLASSICAL THAN OPEN TO EXPERIENCE in MY CREATIVITY</h3>

    <h3>I AM SLIGHTLY MORE INNOVATIVE THAN PRAGMATIC in MY CREATIVITY</h3>
