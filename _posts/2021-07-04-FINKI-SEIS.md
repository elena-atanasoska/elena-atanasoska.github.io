1. **General Information**

  Undergraduate studies in the according study program should provide for superb engineering staff capable of satisfying the ever-increasing demand for software engineers, especially programmers. Students enrolled in this study program acquire knowledge enabling them great professional flexibility and wide choice of employment opportunities wherever there is a need of analysis, specification, design, planning, implementation and programming, project management and maintaining software and information systems. Bachelor of Engineering of this profile can build his own career in software industry, in public and service sector, but especially in software development companies, real-time information systems, mobile and hybrid applications, internet and cloud software, advanced user interfaces, solutions related to design and implementation of software systems, etc. 

2. **Academic title or degree earned with study completion is**  
    2.1 Finished **3-year studies** with 180 credits  Title: **Bachelor of Engineering (Information Technologies), sub-degree: Software Engineering and Information Technologies**  
    2.2 Finished **4-year** studies with 240 credits  Title: **Bachelor of Science (Information Science), sub-degree: Software Engineering and Information Technolgies**

3. **Study program**  
  The study program is conceived with 18 mandatory courses, 9 elective courses from Faculty list and 3 courses from University list, in case of student finishing three-year studies, or 24 mandatory courses, 12 elective courses from Faculty list and 4 courses from University list, in case of student finishing four-year studies.

  All of the elective courses are divided into three difficulty groups (N1, N2 and N3). The rules for course electivity regarding the difficulty level are defined as:

  Number of courses from N1 – total number of credits from chosen elective courses in group N1 must not exceed 6 credits.  
  Number of courses from N2 – total number of credits from chosen elective courses in group N2 must not exceed 36 credits.  
  Number of courses from N3 – there is no limitation on total number of credits from chosen courses in group N3.   
  Students can choose more courses from groups N1 and N2 than it is anticipated, but in that case, credits earned for these courses will not be part of the total number of credits needed for acquiring diploma. Finished courses and earned credits will be part of the finished courses list included in the Faculty’s certificate of completion.
