    <p>Your <b>THINKING</b> measures the abilities you draw upon when solving
        problems and ranges from Intuitive, to Hands-on Learner, to Balanced
        Learner, to Analytical and to Agile.
    </p>
    <p>As an Analytical thinker I pick up information faster than most.
        I am very good at working out the components of complex problems,
        opinions and ideas and this assists me in finding solutions. I have a
        very good ability to evaluate academic challenges as I can spot the
        details and patterns they contain.
